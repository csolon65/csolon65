👋 Hi, I'm @csolon65, a final year student at the European School of Chemistry, Materials and Chemistry in Strasbourg.

👀 I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and chemistry, focusing on how these technologies can drive innovation in science. I'm deeply interested in applying artificial intelligence to the development of new drugs, innovative material formulations, and polymers with novel properties. My passion also extends to process engineering, particularly in optimizing manufacturing processes through AI. In the end, why not say... all areas, because AI is becoming a real asset

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced machine learning and optimization techniques and their applications in predicting chemical properties and behaviors.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that utilize AI to solve real-world problems in the chemical industry.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at caroline.solon@etu.unistra.fr for any collaborative projects or just to exchange ideas!

😄 Pronouns: She/her

⚡ Fun fact: My passion for chemistry was ignited in high school by my physics and chemistry teacher. Five years later, I returned to that same classroom to give a presentation on what it means to be an engineer, my journey in the field, and to enlighten students about the emerging role of AI in chemistry.
